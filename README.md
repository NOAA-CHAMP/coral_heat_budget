MATLAB Toolbox to model a heat budget with all sources of ocean heating on coral reefs

The "coral_heat_budget" repository contains a MATLAB Toolbox developed at NOAA-AOML in Miami, for processing and analyzing environmental time series and spatial fields (including satellite products and model outputs), for the purposes of modeling what forcing drives the heating of coral reef waters. Includes terms for air-sea interaction, radiative fluxes include direct insolation and reflection, advection, mixing, and a process called Horizontal Convection (Monismith et al. 2006).
